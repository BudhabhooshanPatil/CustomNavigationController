# custom_navigation_bar_using_xib

Use UINavigationBar Using XIB to display your app’s navigational controls in a bar along the top of the iOS device’s screen.

A navigation controller object manages its child view controllers using an ordered array, known as the navigation stack. The first view controller in the array is the root view controller and represents the bottom of the stack. The last view controller in the array is the topmost item on the stack, and represents the view controller currently being displayed.
